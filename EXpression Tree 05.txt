 Expression Tree Construction and Operations â€“ DSAL Practical
âœ… 1. Objectives
The objectives of this practical are:

To construct an Expression Tree from a given prefix expression.

To implement a non-recursive post-order traversal of the expression tree.

To perform deletion of the entire tree after traversal.

The expression tree is a binary tree where internal nodes represent operators and leaf nodes represent operands (constants or variables). The challenge here is to construct this tree from a prefix expression and then perform the required operations.

ðŸ“š 2. Theory
ðŸ”¸ What is an Expression Tree?
An Expression Tree is a binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. In such trees:

Leaf nodes contain operands (e.g., numbers or variables).

Internal nodes contain operators (e.g., +, -, *, /).

ðŸ”¸ Prefix Expression
A prefix expression (or Polish notation) is a type of mathematical notation where the operator precedes the operands. For example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
+--a*bc/def
This expression represents:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
((a - (b * c)) + (d / e * f))
ðŸ”¸ Steps to Construct the Expression Tree
Start reading the prefix expression from right to left.

For each operator, pop two operands from the stack, create a new tree node with this operator, and attach the operands as its children.

For each operand, create a leaf node and push it onto the stack.

The final tree on the stack will be the root of the expression tree.

ðŸ”¸ Post-order Traversal (Non-Recursive)
In post-order traversal:

First, traverse the left subtree.

Then, traverse the right subtree.

Finally, visit the root node.

To implement post-order traversal non-recursively, we can use a stack. We need to traverse the left and right subtrees, then process the current node. By using two stacks or a single stack with markers, we can achieve a non-recursive traversal.

ðŸ§® 3. Algorithm
ðŸ“Œ A. Expression Tree Construction
Input: Prefix expression.

Output: Expression Tree.

Steps:
Initialize an empty stack.

Read the prefix expression from right to left.

For each symbol:

If it's an operand (e.g., variable, constant), create a tree node and push it to the stack.

If it's an operator (e.g., +, -), pop two operands from the stack, create a new node with the operator, and push this new node back onto the stack.

At the end of the traversal, the stack will contain one element, which is the root of the expression tree.

ðŸ“Œ B. Non-recursive Post-order Traversal
Initialize two stacks:

One for traversal (stack1).

Another for the final post-order result (stack2).

Push the root node onto stack1.

While stack1 is not empty:

Pop a node from stack1 and push it to stack2.

Push its left and right children onto stack1 (if they exist).

Once the traversal is complete, pop all nodes from stack2 to get the post-order result.

ðŸ“Œ C. Delete the Tree
To delete the tree, perform a post-order traversal and free the memory allocated for each node.

ðŸ”¢ 4. Input / Output
ðŸ“¥ Sample Input:
Prefix Expression: +--a*bc/def

ðŸ“¤ Output:
Expression Tree:
The tree for the expression +--a*bc/def looks like:

        -   *
       / \ / \
      a  * b  /
         / \  / \
        c   d e   f
Post-order Traversal (Non-Recursive):

Deletion Process:
After traversing and printing the tree, we delete the tree nodes one by one, starting from the leaf nodes (post-order deletion).

âœ… 5. Conclusion
In this practical, we have:

Successfully constructed an expression tree from a given prefix expression.

Implemented a non-recursive post-order traversal, allowing us to visit the tree's nodes in the correct order.

Demonstrated the deletion of the tree after performing the traversal.

Time Complexity:
Tree Construction: O(n), where n is the number of operands and operators in the expression.

Post-order Traversal: O(n) as each node is processed exactly once.

Tree Deletion: O(n) as each node must be freed.

Space Complexity:
Expression Tree Construction: O(n), for storing the tree nodes.

Post-order Traversal: O(n), for the stack used in the traversal.

Tree Deletion: O(1) additional space (ignoring recursion stack for post-order traversal).

This exercise is crucial in understanding expression evaluation and tree manipulation techniques, which are widely used in compilers and mathematical expression parsers.
